# 🐎 What is this?

**Horse Reloaded** is a fork of [YimMenu/HorseMenu](https://github.com/YimMenu/HorseMenu) with added features and bug fixes, but most importantly, **greater protections** against P2C *(paid to cheat)* mod menus.

What even is Horse Menu? It's one of the best open source mod menus for a *game related to horses*. It allows to customize your experience in game and protects you from game bugs, and other mod menu users. And this fork adds even more features and protections!

## 🥏 Some questions you might find interesting!

* **Why another fork of Horse Menu?**

  Because the original project is no longer maintained, and I wanted to share my work with the community.

* **Why cant i see the source code?**

  The underground modding community is a bit toxic, and leaving the source code open, would allow P2C mod menus to easily bypass the protections just to stay on top.

* **I want to contribute with ideas or code, how can I do that?**

  There is a public fork of the original [Horse Menu](https://github.com/horse-reloaded/HorseMenu) where you can submit your changes and ideas. They will be reviewed and merged to the main project.

* **Why do you have a paid version?**

  This project includes **cloud features** that requires a server to run, it also motivates development and helps cover costs. No important features are locked behind a paywall and you can still use the menu for free with all the original features and more. 

* **I dont like the idea of the project**

  Fair enough, you can always use the original Horse Menu. This project is made for those who want want stronger protections, easier usability, and a safer overall experience. The project will be made open source when I stop maintaining it.
